This is an important enabler for systems that use auto scaling patterns. We have built an abstraction interface on top of several cache providers we evaluated. This gives us a common model for analyzing performance data, like TPS. We open sourced some of this work into a library called CacheSharp (on Github and NuGet). In this session we’ll show you how we run tests against several providers, establish a baseline of data, and compare the results.

Seasoned in Colorado, his career launched with Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 – he was delivering data-centric solutions while “database developer” was a novel term. He received a civilian Naval Commendation for security work, preceding his work for the Start Up that become Microsoft CRM. The bulk of Jerry's work targeted insurance and finance, especially not-for-profits. For 15 years, he built Microsoft-centric solutions and mobile apps. Today, Jerry speaks on XAML, mobility and Kinect at events, communities, and schools – influencing another generation of excellent, Microsoft developers. To that end, most of Jerry’s free time is spent teaching his three daughters Star Trek character backstories and episode plots.",

This first session creates the foundation for the 2nd Clean Code presentation on Dependency Injection, as it explains expected base knowledge. \n\nWhy writing Clean Code makes us more efficient Over the lifetime of a product, maintaining the product is actually one - if not the most - expensive area(s) of the overall product costs. The Craftsmanship session is exploring the often underestimated importance of clean execution of the coding part and its crucial impact to overall project success. Writing clean code can significantly lower these costs. \n\nHowever, writing clean code also makes you more efficient during the initial development time and results in more stable code. You will be presented design patterns and best practices which will make you write better and more easily maintainable code, seeing code in a holistic way. \n\nYou will learn how to apply them by using an existing implementation as the starting point of the presentation. Finally, practices benefits are explained. \n\nThis presentation is based on C# and Visual Studio 2013.

This session is for programmers interested in using AngularJS seriously and will focus on three patterns of usage: multi-page, single page, and legacy applications. Multi-page applications follow a straight-forward MVC paradigm. Single-page applications with lots of interactions are much more complex, and require the use of nested directives. Legacy applications are those where you can only use Angular in some portions of an existing web application. This requires thoughtful data passing to make your Angular widgets work. In addition, keeping domain logic modular is a challenge, and we will show how we use Typescript to do this. We will also show examples of code before and after Angularizing them, in particular, comparing it to Backbone. If you have never seen AngularJS in action, we recommend taking one of the beginner AngularJS sessions at CodeCamp before you come to this session. If you are starting out with Angular, this session will leave you with a useful map of patterns of wisdom that will help you ask the right questions as you are designing your solution.\n\nPlease download the slides in the Materials link and bring it with you to the session so you can follow along (there's code in it).",

Further, while there are many references on creating REST APIs with XML, there are much fewer references for REST + JSON.\n\nIn this presentation, Les Hazlewood - Stormpath CTO and Apache Shiro PMC Chair - will share all of the golden nuggets learned while designing, implementing and supporting JSON-based REST APIs, using examples from a clean real-world REST+JSON API.  He will cover:\n\n* JSON-based data formats in a RESTful API\n* References to other JSON-based resources (aka 'linking').\n* Resource collections and pagination\n* How to map (and how not to map) HTTP methods to Resource CRUD\n* Resource partial updates\n* Supporting HTTP Method Overloading for clients that don't support HTTP PUT and DELETE\n* API versioning strategies\n* Meaningful Error responses\n* Many-to-many resource relationships\n* HTTP Caching and Optimistic concurrency control.\n* Authentication and Security\n",

Most of these systems have been associated with data delivery and management. Some of the systems I have with with are: Solr, Cassandra, Zookeeper, Hadoop and StubHubs Big Data Platform. All these systems require a different approach in design,development and access patterns.  However, there are underlying patterns in each of these systems. And these patterns radically change the approach of developers and users of these systems. Without them, building and deploying distributed systems, especially at scale, becomes exceedingly problematic.

Most of these systems have been associated with data delivery and management. Some of the systems I have with with are: Solr, Cassandra, Zookeeper, Hadoop and StubHubs Big Data Platform. All these systems require a different approach in design,development and access patterns.  However, there are underlying patterns in each of these systems. And these patterns radically change the approach of developers and users of these systems. Without them, building and deploying distributed systems, especially at scale, becomes exceedingly problematic. I wish to share some of these design and deployment patterns as well as their  programming models with the folks at SVCC.",

I will then present a set of guidelines that are the basis for safe exception usage and solid implementation techniques, including how to transition from an exception-unsafe legacy code base.\n\nWhen we are finished you will know how to produce code that is easier to write, easier to understand, faster, and 100% robust in the face of exceptions.",

These new devices interface directly with mobile devices via a Bluetooth connection and are designed to provide input all day long.\n \nWhat potential does the Brain-Computer Interface provide for wearable purposes? What is the difference between passive monitoring and active detection? What sort of input is possible? Is the Brain-Computer Interface one way, or is direct brain input possible too?\n \nIn this class, we will dive into the future of thought as input for wearable development with real-world examples and code. Demonstrations will be shown using the Emotiv EPOC headset, a high resolution, neuro-signal acquisition and processing wireless neuroheadset that uses a set of sensors to tune into electric signals produced by the brain to detect thoughts, feelings and expressions. Additional devices will be discussed and may be used as they become available.\n \nYou will see the EEG neuroheadset and brain-computer interface with examples of interfacing with desktop and mobile apps. We will dive into the roots of the technology, showing code and examples along with big pictures of the technology.

GameMaker Studio is also advanced enough for seasoned game developers to build games for desktops, web (HTML5),  and Android & iOS mobile devices.\n\nIn this hands-on tutorial, you will be introduced to GameMaker Studio drag and drop functionality to build an arcade game, with brief exposure to scripting.  In the process, you will learn how to create a \"game plan\", identifying the game assets and objects, and designing behaviors and interactions.  I will also mention the advantages of GameMaker over other game development environments such as Stencyl,  GameSalad, Construct 2, and Unity.\n\nIf you'd like to do the exercise, please  bring a Windows laptop or a Mac with Windows on a Virtual Machine or Bootcamp. Also, if possible, download and install the free GameMaker Studio Standard ahead of time (http://www.yoyogames.com/studio/download)",

We will explore real-world big data problems and talk about architectures, APIs, and key parts of HBase for developing efficient big data applications to solve these problems. In this session, you will learn how setup MapR Sandbox and get started with HBase application development. We will go through some best practices and how to apply them using demos and code.\nI can present this as a 50 minutes session or 120 minutes Hands-on Lab/Session.",

For example, in HBase you cannot do transactions spanning multiple tables.  In this session, you will learn how, in some cases, to work around to implement transactions using HBase. We will explore real-world big data problems and talk about architectures, APIs, and key parts of HBase for developing efficient big data applications to solve these problems. In this session, you will learn how setup MapR Sandbox and get started with HBase application development. We will go through some best practices and how to apply them using demos and code.\nI can present this as a 50 minutes session or 120 minutes Hands-on Lab/Session.",

This growth is measured by Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS). eNPS helps understand which elements of employee engagement advocate employee loyalty and which areas require improvement. This effort in turn leads to better products and happier customers.\n",

To start, we will purchase and put together the raw hardware. But software rules the world, and that’s where a bulk of the presentation will focus. The code will need to be able to take a picture and upload it to the cloud. From there, a push notification will need to be sent to the appropriate mobile device(s), indicating that someone has pressed the doorbell, and that the photo is available.\n\nWhat other capabilities with respect to CPU, memory, and storage?\nWhat expansion boards are available and what purpose do they serve?\nWhat type of programming tools are available?\nWhat programming languages are supported in the device itself?\nWhat role does the cloud play with respect to security?\nWhich networking connectivity solutions that should be considered for device-to-cloud communication?\nHow does the cloud help alleviate bandwidth challenges and minimize power consumption on the device?\nWhat are the four patterns for device to cloud service message communication?\n",

The course also features an in-depth live demonstration of the architecture and principles at work.\nWe begin with trying to establish a clear functional definition of row-level security, and an examination of real-world contexts which either demand or benefit from such a model.  \nWe then discuss the various kinds of requirements that can impact level of complexity of a particular solution.  This leads us into developing a database model that supports the standard superset of likely use-cases.  We’ll start with the simplest possible implementation and then discuss the addition of layers of complexity such as the classic “Top Secret / Confidential / Classified / UnClassified” hierarchies, and other approaches to access.\nFinally, we’ll connect to a live Microsoft SQL Server database with many of these principles implemented, and conduct several tests and demonstrations which illustrate how to implement the principles.\n",

You'll see real-life examples and issues such as: Creating a new table; Choosing data types; Normalization (and when to denormalize); Types of relationships; Referential integrity; Join/relationship tables; 1-to-many, many-to-many; How to actually use these structures in your application; While the examples will focus on SQL Server, the techniques and SQL code will work for virtually any SQL database.

Combining Machine Learning with cloud technologies, such as Azure, reduces the friction and lowers the knowledge barriers for people doing their own experimentation on data. Azure ML, a new offering from Microsoft, allows us to harness the power or Machine Learning and Big Data with little more than a browser and a credit card. In this session, we will take a look at how to create ML models with Azure ML Studio and deploy those models to production in minutes.

Combining Machine Learning with cloud technologies, such as Azure, reduces the friction and lowers the knowledge barriers for people doing their own experimentation on data. Azure ML, a new offering from Microsoft, allows us to harness the power or Machine Learning and Big Data with little more than a browser and a credit card. In this session, we will take a look at how to create ML models with Azure ML Studio and deploy those models to production in minutes.

It would be very useful to be able to express the same sequential representation in a unit test, with the operations in different threads defined in the same flow.\n\nI present a framework for doing this. It ships lambda expressions to any number of locally initialized threads, synchronizing, or optionally randomizing, the start times of each thread's block of code, and providing mechanisms to check in an assertion (for example) whether two or more threads are deadlocked or livelocked, whether a point of execution was reached while it was expected to be protected, and other such violations of concurrency expectations. Mechanisms are also provided for looping and timing.",

It would be very useful to be able to express the same sequential representation in a unit test, with the operations in different threads defined in the same flow.\n\nI present a framework for doing this. It ships lambda expressions to any number of locally initialized threads, synchronizing, or optionally randomizing, the start times of each thread's block of code, and providing mechanisms to check in an assertion (for example) whether two or more threads are deadlocked or livelocked, whether a point of execution was reached while it was expected to be protected, and other such violations of concurrency expectations. Mechanisms are also provided for looping and timing.",

Then you need to learn about managed data services in Bluemix.  We will show how IBM Bluemix, an open-standards, cloud-based developer platform for building, deploying and managing apps can be leveraged for rapid application development on the cloud built on top of enterprise-level data services.  We will discuss and demo two such Bluemix services, SQL Database and Analytics Warehouse.  SQL Database adds an on-demand relational database to your Bluemix hosted application.  Powered by DB2, it provides a managed database service to handle demanding web and transactional workloads.  Analytics Warehouse service can be used for predictive analytics which can be applied to many areas including business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) areas, such as customer acquisition, retention, and winback. These analytics can be applied to technical tasks, such as predictive maintenance.  We will discuss how can we leverage analytics service in the cloud to provide the statistical analysis capability of R by using sample data sets that are stored in the BLU Acceleration for Cloud database.  Join us to get hands on and learn how to use SQLDB, AWH, and In-database R capability in the cloud. You will also learn to pump-in NOSQL document datasets into the warehouse for predictive analytics.",

RTI Data Distribution Service (DDS) will be used as the source of data and as a communication channel for asynchronous data streams. On top of DDS, we'll use Rx to subscribe, observe, project, filter, aggregate, merge, zip, and correlate one or more data streams (Observables). The live demo will be very visual as bouncing shapes of different colors will be transformed in front of you using C# lambdas, Rx.NET, and LinqPad. You will also learn about the new Rx4DDS.NET library that integrates RTI DDS with Rx.NET. Rx and DDS are a great match because both are reactive. Rx is based on the subject-observer pattern, which is quite analogous to the publish-subscribe pattern of DDS. When used together they support distributed dataflows seamlessly. If time permits, we will touch upon advanced Rx concepts such as stream of streams (IGroupedObservable) and how it captures DDS \"keyed topics\". The DDS applications using Rx4DDS.NET dramatically simplify concurrency to the extent that it can be simply configured. Sounds too good to be true? Listen to the talk and watch the demo.",

After seven years of working on JIRA, Stash and other developer tools out of Atlassian's Australian office, he made the move to San Francisco. Today, Tim's official job title is Developer Provocateur. \n \nTim thinks that all software, but particularly developer tools, should be built with extensibility in mind. He splits his days between building tools and platform APIs for Atlassian's developer ecosystem and blogging or speaking about developer tools, API design and building hackable products. \n \nTim also claims the first commit to Stash, Atlassian's enterprise Git repository management tool. His time on Stash taught him more about Git than is probably healthy, and he enjoys regularly speaking and blogging about Git arcanery.\n \nBeyond his day job, Tim enjoys hacking on Android games and 3D graphics. His current pet project is a libgdx-powered arcade-style shooter that he hopes to release to critical acclaim later this year (although this is the 3rd year he's said that).",

Today, Tim's official job title is Developer Provocateur. \n \nTim thinks that all software, but particularly developer tools, should be built with extensibility in mind. He splits his days between building tools and platform APIs for Atlassian's developer ecosystem and blogging or speaking about developer tools, API design and building hackable products. \n \nTim also claims the first commit to Stash, Atlassian's enterprise Git repository management tool. His time on Stash taught him more about Git than is probably healthy, and he enjoys regularly speaking and blogging about Git arcanery.\n \nBeyond his day job, Tim enjoys hacking on Android games and 3D graphics. His current pet project is a libgdx-powered arcade-style shooter that he hopes to release to critical acclaim later this year (although this is the 3rd year he's said that).",

This session will take an in-depth look at some of the key challenges facing entrepreneurs whose products and services are starting to sell, and who are experiencing rapidly-expanding growth.  The goal of the session is to leaving you asking the right questions of the right people so you can set up appropriate, scalable business processes BEFORE your well-deserved growth turns into months-on-end of business-process fire-fighting and sleepless nights, especially for your CFO and CEO.  You’d rather get back to innovating, so why not set yourself up for graceful growth from the beginning?\nWe’ll examine common systems growing companies need such as quote-to-cash pipeline, revenue recognition and revenue forecasting, to name a few.  We’ll discuss the usual causes of problem faced by these systems, and take a look at additional problems associated with those same causes.  Then we’ll discuss data and system planning and architecture methodologies that can help you grapple with these challenges, ideally before they even occur, so that your path to success can be smoother, swifter and much more profitable.\nAlong the way we’ll discuss requirements-gathering, product- and customer-to-business-process matrices, data integration concerns, and actual business process and workflow design.\n",

Then the speaker will cover aspects of modernization & globalization including eco-innovation, crowdsourcing and pre-tailing. This section will end by offering “insider hints” highlighting how to collaborate with a fashion company.\n\nSecond we will cover advanced technologies used to build wearable fashion with an overview of MEMS (motion, position, environmental and capture) sensors and wireless (NFC, Bluetooth 4.0) connectivity used to build wearable fashion with code samples (iOS & Android) capturing physiological data. We will review of the current wearable market (eg. Nike Fuelband, Shine, Lark, Fitbit, Bodybug & Google - Glass / Moto / Ara).  This section will provide a real world example of placing Bluetooth 4.0 connected MEMS devices into a shoe which will lead to some surprising capabilities (telling us how to exercise properly).  This section will conclude by exploring this final thought.   “If it looks amazing and does not work well people will forgive but if it works great and it is ugly, no one will wear it.”\n\nThe talk will culminate by showing how these two industries will co-evolve and the different forms these collaborations can take.

Tenaya is a Rogue Maker and since March 16th 2013, has been learning all about Arduino, Linino, and Lilypad Arduino.  Tenaya holds a B.A. degree in Theatre & Drama, Geological Sciences, and Anthropology.  Her Grandpa was a Tau Beta Pi Engineer and Eta Kappa Nu Electrical Engineer...so it's only natural that Tenaya earned Phi Beta Kappa in 2005 (of course with much hard work!) She is mostly self taught in microcontroller coding and electrical engineering.  Diane and Esther, Tenaya's mom and grandma, taught her how to sew and now those skills are really paying off to use conductive thread to sew LEDs into garments.  Join us for a fun workshop to introduce you to sewing LEDs into your own clothing.  We'll also provide fabric to inspire you and to practice the parallel circuits.  Tenaya teaches a 3 part workshop where we 1) Design 2) Prototype, and 3) Make (sew!) Choose from 6 colors of LEDs with Tenaya's #RogueMaking Lilypad kits. More sensors and LEDs are available through the workshop as well. Rogue Making wearable tech kits will be an additional $20-$35 for take-home materials to keep. Prototyping materials, fabric, and sewing supplies provided.",

Writing an application that lazily loads large amounts of data from the server, includes drag-and-drop and compelling visualizations does not require one to write any HTML or  JavaScript.\n\nThe framework is based on a server centric development model that provides the best productivity, but it also supports client-side development with the built-in GWT Java to JavaScript compiler. It also allows you to go through the abstractions and write JavaScript directly. The looks of the application is customized with SASS language using powerful Valo theme. The end result can be run in any HTML5 capable browser and deployed to any Java based server or cloud.\n\nThe presentation gives an overview to Vaadin and explains how it works.

However, with great power also comes great power to do things incorrectly, which leads to many projects based on XAML technologies that are in trouble in some way. In this session Markus will take a look at XAML Anti-Patterns – common solutions that end up being ineffective and counterproductive. Among the discussed patterns and techniques are things like bootstrappers, virtualization, resources, XAML itself, and much, much more. Many of the presented topics may surprise even advanced XAML developers.\n\n",

However, with great power also comes great power to do things incorrectly, which leads to many projects based on XAML technologies that are in trouble in some way. In this session Markus will take a look at XAML Anti-Patterns – common solutions that end up being ineffective and counterproductive. Among the discussed patterns and techniques are things like bootstrappers, virtualization, resources, XAML itself, and much, much more. Many of the presented topics may surprise even advanced XAML developers.\n\n",

Fortunately, with the new JavaFX ZombieTime app, powered by the JSR 310 Date and Time API, you can rest easy.  With built-in time zone and DST support you no longer have to worry about roaming around under the scorching hot sun.  Accurately calculate out how long you have to infect the villagers before you decompose using Durations.  And coordinate global attacks on the humans by syncing with your undead brethren on Instants.  With the power of Java 8, eradicating the human race with a highly infectious virus has never been easier!\n\nThis presentation is designed to teach Java Date and Time APIs to the undead, but the living are welcome to be our \"guests\".  You may also learn some JavaFX in the process -- that is entirely my fault.
